Luke Jordan is a direct student of Sri K Pattabhi Jois and one of a handful of teachers worldwide Certified by the [Ashtanga Yoga Institute][0] in Mysore to pass on the advanced teachings of this traditional Yoga method.

Beginning the daily practise of Ashtanga in 2000, Luke soon made his way to Mysore to study with Guru Sri K. Pattabhi Jois in 2001 and now continues his studies under the direction of Sharath Jois. For many years Luke has travelled the world giving classes and workshops and is very excited to be directing this special programme again in Rotterdam.

Luke holds a Masters degree in Indian Religion (specialising in Yoga philosophy) and seeks to integrate the philosophical and physical dimensions both within his own practise and his teachings.
